Bloom is a public goods funding platform built on the BNB Greenfield chain. We offer a streamlined
approach where individuals and organizations can directly donate to projects they believe in,
without the need for intermediaries. Leveraging the power of BNB technology, our platform ensures
transparent and secure transactions while fostering innovation and collaboration within the
community. Project creators can submit their initiatives to be funded. Furthermore, individuals can
offer their support with their skills or passion, contributing to the success of projects beyond
financial donations. Join us in empowering builders and DAO communities to drive positive change
and impact within the decentralized space.

We believe in the power of community and collaboration. That's why we create a space for
individuals to offer their expertise and passion directly to projects in need.

All data storage and transactions are handled on the BNB Greenfield Chain.
